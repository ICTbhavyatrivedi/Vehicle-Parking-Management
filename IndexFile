<h3>Parking Problems!!</h3>
<p>
    India is facing a new problem nowadays â€“ lack of sufficient parking space. With families getting smaller and 
	the total number of motor vehicles exceeding the total number of heads per family, the parking scenario is woefully 
	falling short of the current requirements in the country. The situation is such that on any given working day
	approximately 40% of the roads in urban India are taken up for just parking the cars. The problem has been further 
	exacerbated by the fact that nowadays even people from low income group are able to own cars. The number of families
	with cars has become much more than what the country is able to manage.

<h3>Multilevel Parking</h3>
<p>
    The growing population of India has created many problems - one of the challenging ones being car parking which
	we confront almost every day. Besides the problem of space for cars moving on the road, greater is the problem of space
	for a parked vehicle considering that private vehicles remain parked for most of their time. Roads are being built for cars to ply
	but are we also giving the vehicles enough space to park? While residential projects still escape with designated parking,
	the real problem lie with commercial spaces - many a time which is overcome by taking extra open spaces to park.
